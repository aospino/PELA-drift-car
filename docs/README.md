# PELA Autonomous Drift Car
## 3D Printed LEGO-compatible Parametric 1:10 Scale RC Drift Car Cover Based On [PELA Blocks](http://pelablocks.org)

A high-end RC drift car is modified with 3D printed PELA blocks, LEGO technics, a Raspberry Pi 3+ and camera to drive itself. Snap on additional sensors and custom body parts as your design evolves. At Futurice, we use this to compete and learn. Our different offices race each other to see who has the mad deep learning skills to drive the car around a track the fastest.

To install, get the last preview release of [OpenSCAD](https://www.openscad.org/) then:

`git clone git@github.com:LEGO-compatible-gadgets/PELA-drift-car.git --recurse-submodules`

**This drift car is a work in progress.** PELA Blocks and some imagination with LEGO technics will offer you all the parts you need and see here in the picture. Instructions are currently a bit thin as we iterate fast. We'll get to it. Promise.

This car has been designed to compete in [Markku.ai](https://markku.ai/). You can find more resources and ideas there. **Markku.ai** is a **Donkeycar**-derived autonomous driving competition based using high end 1:10 electric drift cars. If you're going to crah- do it with style.

Please see [donkeycar.com](http://www.donkeycar.com/) for help with the basic software setup. This car is a high performace, pimped-out version of what you find there.



## Models

[![PELA Drift Car Center Beam](images/PELA-drift-car-center-beam.png)](https://github.com/LEGO-compatible-gadgets/PELA-drift-car/blob/master/PELA-drift-car-center-beam.stl)

[PELA Drift Car Center Beam](https://github.com/LEGO-compatible-gadgets/PELA-drift-car/blob/master/PELA-drift-car-center-beam.stl) A configurable mounting beam that can run down the top center of an RC car. This is the spine on which other modules are mounted. This makes future upgrades and field reconfiguration and repair easier using only technic pins rather than needing to design and print a new part each time. For smaller printers you may render this as two shorter sections that can be joined with two old LEGO technic beams you probably have laying around (or use [PELA technic beam](https://pelablocks.org)).

[![PELA Drift Car Tamiya TT-02 End Connector](images/PELA-drift-car-tt02-end-connector.png)](https://github.com/LEGO-compatible-gadgets/PELA-drift-car/blob/master/PELA-drift-car-tt02-end-connector.stl)

[PELA Drift Car Tamiya TT-02 End Connector](https://github.com/LEGO-compatible-gadgets/PELA-drift-car/blob/master/PELA-drift-car-tt02-end-connector.stl) An adapter for both ends of the Drift Car Center Beam. Two mounting holes at each end allow quick disconnect of the entire electronics beam from the donor Tamiya TT-02 1:10 RC drift car. The hole line up with the TT-02 body shell mount holes. You can use for example a technic beam with small holes drilled for cotter pins. Print two copies.

## Downloading

If you prefer to avoid git, you can download the files instead.

1. Download and unzip **[PELA Drift Car](https://github.com/LEGO-Prototypes/PELA-drift-car/archive/master.zip)**
1. Download and unzip **[PELA Blocks](https://github.com/LEGO-Prototypes/PELA-blocks/archive/master.zip)** as a subdirectory inside the above (`PELA-robot-hand/PELA-blocks`)
1. **Calibrate** the models to your printer/filament/slicer/preferences (see below)

## Git Clone

1. `git clone git@github.com:LEGO-compatible-gadgets/PELA-drift-car.git --recurse-submodules`
1. **Calibrate** the models to your printer/filament/slicer/preferences (see below)
1. Before `git submodule update --remote` to get PELA Blocks project changes, you may want to [backup your print calibration files](http://pelablocks.org/#calibration-file-backup)

## Calibration

**IMPORTANT:** The STL models must be customized for your material, printer and slicer. First **[calibrate](http://pelablocks.org/#calibrate)** the PELA blocks for your printer to achieve a nice snap fit.

See also [Advanced Calibration](http://pelablocks.org/ADVANCED-CALIBRATION)

## Calibration File Backup

If you later update the PELA-blocks project to a newer version, you risk overwirting and loosing your calibration customizations. The simplest solution is to create a backup copy those settings.

1. `cd PELA-drift-car/PELA-Blocks`
1. `cp PELA-parameters.scad ../PELA-parameters-backup.scad`
1. `cp PELA-print-parameters.scad ../PELA-print-parameters-backup.scad`

## Use

Edit the [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/) files to generate different views such as one finger at a time.

Be patient, have a nice meal and a coffee, the models are complex and render slowly.
